# Gender Classification with Unlabeled CelebA Dataset 

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing an innovative machine learning model for gender classification using the CelebA dataset. Our approach utilizes semi-supervised learning techniques, specifically co-teaching and co-training, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of gender prediction. By harnessing the power of unlabeled data, we aim to build a highly effective gender classification model.

## Features
- Gender classification using the CelebA dataset.
- Incorporates co-teaching and co-training techniques.
- Enhances gender prediction through semi-supervised learning.
